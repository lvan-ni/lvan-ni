### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on a portfolio website for a friend of mine. It's been super fun to explore how to use animation with Framer Motion.


🦄 From a decade in graphic design to diving deep into code, my journey's been a blend of aesthetics and algorithms.

👨🏻‍💻 Currently navigating the full-stack world, I'm passionate about fusing design principles with web development to craft compelling digital experiences.

✨ Exploring innovative ways where design & technology intersect to make the web more user-centric.
