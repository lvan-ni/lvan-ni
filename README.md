### Hi there 👋

🖌️ From a decade in graphic design to diving deep into code, my journey's been a blend of aesthetics and algorithms.

👩‍💻 Currently navigating the full-stack world, I'm passionate about fusing design principles with web development to craft compelling digital experiences.

🔍 Exploring innovative ways where design & technology intersect to make the web more user-centric.

📚 Always learning, always coding. Check out my repositories to see what I'm up to!

🌍 Based in Stockholm, Sweden.
