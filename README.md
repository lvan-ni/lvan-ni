### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on a portfolio website for a friend of mine. It's been super fun to explore how to use animation to create useful and fun moments with Framer Motion.

😁 Feel free to follow my progress on [my portfolio](https://www.lvanni.org) and reach out.

🦄 From a decade in graphic design to diving deep into code, in my blend of aesthetics and algorithms dream.

👨🏻‍💻 Currently navigating the full-stack world, I'm passionate about fusing design principles with web development to craft compelling digital experiences.

✨ Where design & technology intersect is where magic happens for me.
