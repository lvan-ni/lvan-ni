### Hi there 👋 I'm Lvan

🔭 I’m currently working on a portfolio website for a friend of mine as well as organsing and fixing some previous projects.

😁 Feel free to follow my progress on [my portfolio](https://www.lvanni.org) and reach out.

🦄 From a decade in graphic design to a SALT Stockholm full-stack graduate, I'm in my blend of aesthetic and algroithm dream with new found power of code.

👨🏻‍💻 I'm passionate about fusing design principles with web development to craft compelling digital experiences.
